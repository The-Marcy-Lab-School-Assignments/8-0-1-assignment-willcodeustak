/*
__dirname:

Represents the absolute path to the directory where your current script (file) is located. It tells you the exact location of that script within your file system.


dist:

This is a specific folder or directory you want to reference or work with. It could be a folder that contains compiled files, static assets, or other resources.

Using path Module:

The path module helps you connect __dirname with dist (or any other folder) by combining paths in a way thatâ€™s correct and consistent across different operating systems.

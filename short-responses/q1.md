# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer

~~A middleware function acts like a barrier , choosing to not reveal to client until developer reasoning is added into it~~

"A "middleware" is a type of controller that can also parse requests and perform server-side actions.

Unlike normal controllers, middleware functions pass the request to the next function in the chain without sending a response to the client. They sit in the "middle" of the chain of middleware/controllers."

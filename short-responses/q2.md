# Question

What does the `__dirname` environment variable return?

# Answer

__dirname is a global variable that provides the absolute path to the directory where your code is located.

Because __dirname is a global variable that provides the exact path to the directory where your code is located, you can use it to build file paths dynamically. This makes it easy to create paths to files or folders starting from the directory where your code is.

When you use path.join(__dirname, 'folder', 'file.txt'), you are creating a complete path to file.txt inside the folder, starting from the exact location of your code.
